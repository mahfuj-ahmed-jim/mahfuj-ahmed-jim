![Software Developer](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I am a software developer, specializing in the app development arena. For the last 3 years, I have been developing games using Java, Kotlin, and Dart programming languages.

I’m currently working as a freelancer software developer. I’m hands-on in all stages of the software development cycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment. No two days are the same for me; my tasks may involve analyzing algorithms, altering code, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas, or integrating new systems.

Something that I love about software development is the opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. The software development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as a people person and someone who loves to build new relationships, it’s great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.

Skills: Java / Dart / Kotlin / JS / Flutter / Postman / SQL
